# CIFAR10-Classification
CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The images are 32x32 pixels, making them relatively small and challenging for classification due to low resolution and the variety of objects.
